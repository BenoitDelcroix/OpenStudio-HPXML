#Pseudo-Code for Heat Pump Sizing Condition
def assign_hvac_sizing_condition(mj, system_design_loads, hvac_heating, hvac_cooling)
Assign HVAC sizing condition "String Classification" that takes in system design loads from MJ
Step 1: produce MJ load calc (already done)
Step 2: follow equipment selection and sizing procedure flowchart
	- if system is heat pump, determine HP sizing condition
	- else, either clg only, furnace, or boiler yes/no checks
Step 3: procure OEM performance data
	- is forced air system?
	- water-air system?
	- ACF required? (altitude above 2,500 ft)
	- extract capacity from OEM performance data, interpolate if necessary
	- determine blower CFM
Step 4: apply sizing requirements (normative section N2)
